pigz 2.6 (6 Feb 2021) by Mark Adler

pigz, which stands for Parallel Implementation of GZip, is a fully functional
replacement for gzip that exploits multiple processors and multiple cores to
the hilt when compressing data.

pigz was written by Mark Adler and does not include third-party code. I am
making my contributions to and distributions of this project solely in my
personal capacity, and am not conveying any rights to any intellectual property
of any third parties.

This version of pigz is written to be portable across Unix-style operating
systems that provide the zlib and pthread libraries.

Type "make" in this directory to build the "pigz" executable.  You can then
install the executable wherever you like in your path (e.g. /usr/local/bin/).
Type "pigz" to see the command help and all of the command options.

The latest version of pigz can be found at http://zlib.net/pigz/ .  You need
zlib version 1.2.3 or later to compile pigz.  zlib version 1.2.6 or later is
recommended, which reduces the overhead between blocks.  You can find the
latest version of zlib at http://zlib.net/ .  You can look in pigz.c for the
change history.
