Requirements
------------
You will need a C++ compiler.
GCC is more than sufficient to compile it but the code should compile with any
standards compliant compiler.
GCC is available at http://gcc.gnu.org/.

You will also need gnu Make.
GCC is available at https://gnu.org/software/make/.

Procedure
---------
1. Unpack the archive if you have not done so already:

	tar -xf pigz-[version].tar.gz
or
	gzip -dc pigz-[version].tar.gz | tar -xf -

This creates the directory ./pigz-[version] containing the source from
the main archive.

2. Change to lzip directory.

	cd pigz-[version]

3. Run make.

	make

4. Optionally, type 'make test' to run the tests that come with pigz.

5. Type 'make install' to install the program and any data files and
   documentation.

   Or type 'make install-compress', which additionally compresses the
   info manual and the man page after installation. (Installing
   compressed docs may become the default in the future).

   You can install only the program, the info manual or the man page by
   typing 'make install-bin', 'make install-info' or 'make install-man'
   respectively.
