Compresses according to the deflate specification and append the compressed
result to the output.
This function will usually output multiple deflate blocks. If final is 1, then
the final bit will be set on the last block.

options: global program options
btype: the deflate block type. Use 2 for best compression.
  -0: non compressed blocks (00)
  -1: blocks with fixed tree (01)
  -2: blocks with dynamic tree (10)
final: whether this is the last section of the input, sets the final bit to the
  last deflate block.
in: the input bytes
insize: number of input bytes
bp: bit pointer for the output array. This must initially be 0, and for
  consecutive calls must be reused (it can have values from 0-7). This is
  because deflate appends blocks as bit-based data, rather than on byte
  boundaries.
out: pointer to the dynamic output array to which the result is appended. Must
  be freed after use.
outsize: pointer to the dynamic output array size.
